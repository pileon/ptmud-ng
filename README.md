# PTMUD-NG

The next generation of PTMUD.

## What is PTMUD-NG?

PTMUD was an old [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) server based on
[CircleMUD](https://www.circlemud.org), which in turn was based on
[DikuMUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD).

PTMUD-NG is a new or next generation of PTMUD, written from scratch in modern
C++.

PTMUD-NG is not meant to be backward compatible with either the old PTMUD or
with CircleMUD or other existing MUD code-bases.
