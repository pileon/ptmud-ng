# Game mechanics

The game mechanics of a role-playing game is always controversial. Should
it be based on an existing RPG mechanics? Which one should it then be based
on? If not, then how similar to other systems can we kmake it without
plagiarizing to much or risk copyright infringement?

As a DikuMUD variant, should PTMUD-NG strictly follow the DikuMUD mechanics,
which in turn were modeled (if not plainly copied from) AD&D, or should we
make up our own system? And if we make up our own system how much should we
deviate from the standard DikuMUD mechanisms?

To answer all those questions, PTMUD-NG will be using its own system, written
from scratch for PTMUD-NG. However due to the nature of RPG's, it might seem
similar or inspired by other systems, and will certainly have some common
concepts to other systems. The PTMUD-NG mechanics will be very different from
the "standard" DikuMUD mechanics in many ways.

## Levels and XP

PTMUD-NG will have levels and experience points (XP). There will not be a
(practical) limit to the number of levels though, and the amount of XP needed
for each level will be algorithmically calculated.

## Classes

PTMUD-NG will be classless. Any player can pick any set of skills or spells for
progression.

## Attributes

Attributes in PTMUD-NG are the base character attributes, like strength or
dexterity.

All attributes will have a value from 1 (non-existant) to 100 (maxed out). It's
only possible to get zero or a negative value from affections from spells or
equipment.

## Health, movement and "mana"

Equipment can't put a characters health at or below zero, and non-offensive
spells can't put a characters health below zero.

## Skills

## Spells

## Character creation

## Character level up
